![Stack]([http://url/to/img.png](https://ik.imagekit.io/py9r3vcv5/stack.png?updatedAt=1762772835070)

## Run Project using `yarn start` OR `npm start`

## In this project I have used:
- **Create React App** to create React Application
- **Bootstrap** for CSS
- MockApis, to render the data on the page using **MockForMe** (MockForMe integration is super fast only 2 lines of code is required)
  - I have used MockForMe NPM Package https://www.npmjs.com/package/mockforme
  - Validate application in multiple scenerios
  - Test application in slow network using MockForMe Delay feature
  - You can create mockapis in MockForMe dashboard https://dashboard.mockforme.com, you can also see the documentation https://docs.mockforme.com
- Deploy the application on Vercel (Vercel is quite handy you just need to provide the public github repository path)

> **_NOTE:_**  I have committed my mockforme token intentionally so anyone check application running.
> This stack can improve your development efficiency and quality of releases.
